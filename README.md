![gslash](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shrugs/gslash/master/app/images/icon-128.png)

Chrome extension that adds a global shortcut for focusing search boxes on arbitrary pages.

## Usage

`Cmd+/` or `Ctrl+/` will focus the main search box on a page. After installing, test it out on [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=test) or your favorite website!

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Check **Develper Mode** checkbox.
4. Click **Load Unpacked Extension**
5. Select the `gslash/app` directory.
6. ???
7. Profit!
8. Test it out on [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=test) or your favorite website!

## Notes

Doesn't currently work on websites that think they're too good for html inputs.
*cough* Facebook *cough*. Luckily, those are the same types of websites that implement the standard '/' shortcut to autofocus their own search boxes.
